This final project was a Workout Tracker program that will help users track their workouts and also give helpful workout ideas.
There are 3 different workout types: push, pull, and legs. At the "login" screen, you can either load a profile or create a new
one to begin. Then, you have a user interface to see the available workouts, view stats, start a new workout, load a different profile,
save current profile data, or quit.
